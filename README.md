Full stack expense tracking application

Small app that demonstrates MongoDB atlas cloud database, Express built API and Morgan middleware.
I started by creating a seperate client app first that saved to the state.
Then created a cloud database with Mongo Atlas to store current and new transactions.
Finally, Express helped me create a Rest api for handling requests.
